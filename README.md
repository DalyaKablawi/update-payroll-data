# Assignment 03

# JavaScript: 

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to update the source code with functions to render the required information on the page and in the console as instructed.

I did this by:

- Completing the collectEmployees function by adding a while loop that adds data that the user is prompted to enter to the empty totalEmployees array.
- Added an object to store the user data, and pushed the contents into the array.
- Console logging the array and returning the array to render on the page in the form of a table 
- Completing the displayAverageSalary function by adding the salary values and dividing them by the length of the array and logging the results to the console.
- Completing the getRandomEmployee function by adding a Math.random function to generate a random employee and logging the result to the console. 

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria
