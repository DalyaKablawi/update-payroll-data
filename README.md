# Assignment 03

# JavaScript: 

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a page introducing myself and showcasing my projects in a portfolio webpage.

I did this by:

- Creating a webpage with the title "Assignment 2: Portfolio: with a favicon of my picture.
- Using custom fonts in my headers and my body text.
- Including an image of me in the header.
- Creating an "About Me" section wherein I introduced myself, a "Projects" section displaying my projects and a "Contact Me" section with a form that potential employers can fill out to get in touch with me.
- Creating links embedded within the projects such that employers are taken to a separate page containing the respective project.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good
candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to
sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
